Beyond Lucky 7 - Extended Encoding Object Design
================================================

While the given :doc:`Lucky 7 </design/lucky 7>` represents the simplest possible encoding object one can design, there are several more type definitions, member functions, and other things an individual can use to create more complex encoding objects. Below, we are going to review the most pertinent ones that allow for better extensibility of the core design and let you go `Even Further Beyond <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTelnNmRUH0>`_.



Extension 0: Separate Encode/Decode States
------------------------------------------

It is no secret that encoding and decoding may carrying with them separate states. While converting from a legacy encoding to Unicode may require maintenance of a shift state or code unit modifier, the opposite direction may not need any at all. Therefore, as an optimization, an encoding object can define both an ``encode_state`` and a ``decode_state``, seperate from each other. As an example, here is a (simplified) version of how :doc:`ztd::text::execution </api/encodings/execution>`, the encoding for the Locale-based Runtime Execution Encoding, has two seperate states that need to be initialized in different manners:

.. literalinclude:: /../../examples/documentation/source/design.beyond_lucky_7.encode_state_and_decode_state.cpp
	:language: cpp
	:linenos:
	:lines: 30-62,87

This is the proper way to initialize a ``std::mbstate_t`` from the C standard library. Then, you can use it:

.. literalinclude:: /../../examples/documentation/source/design.beyond_lucky_7.encode_state_and_decode_state.cpp
	:language: cpp
	:linenos:
	:lines: 31-35,66-87

This allows you to maintain 2 different states from
