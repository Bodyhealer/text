Preventing Lost information
===========================

One of the biggest problems facing text processing in programming languages today is the loss of information as its carried through any given system. In C and C++, this comes in the form of all strings - especially multibyte strings - being given the same type. For example:

.. code-block:: cpp
	:linenos:

	void read_name(const char* name) {
		// (1)
	}

As the maintainer of code inside of the function ``read_name``, what is the encoding of "name" at ``(1)``? What is its normalization form? What system did it originate from? The function written in C++ form offers very little benefit either:

.. code-block:: cpp
	:linenos:

	void read_name(std::string name) {
		// (1)
	}


Even here, we've only made marginal improvements. We know the string is stored in some heap by the default allocator, we have the size of the string, but that only tells us how many ``char`` units are stored, not how many conceptual, human-readable characters there are or any other pertinent information.
