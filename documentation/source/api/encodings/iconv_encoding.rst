ðŸ”¨ iconv_encoding (In Progress)
===============================

.. warning::

	|unfinished_warning|

This encoding is only available if the :ref:`configuration macro for ZTD_TEXT_USE_ICONV <config-ZTD_TEXT_USE_ICONV>` is turned on.

This encoding is tied to the `iconv library <https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/>`_. It will attempt to bootstrap iconv on first use of the encoding through use of ``GetProcAddress``/``dlsym`` and friends. If it cannot find it will either assert, abort, or loudly annoy the user in some way. The code is retrieved dynamically, as iconv is under a LGPL/GPL licensed and cannot be traditionally built / statically linked with application code (though in the future we may provide a way for software to do that if the software being made with this library is also GPL-compatible software).

iconv has a fixed set of encodings it can be compiled with to support. States are pre-constructed in the encoding itself and copied as necessary when ``encode_state`` or ``decode_state``\ s are being created to call the iconv functions. The user can inspect the output error parameter from the ``iconv_encoding`` constructor to know of failure, or not pass in the output error parameter and instead take one of a assert, thrown exception, or ``abort`` (preferred invocation in that order).
