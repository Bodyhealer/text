Title: "All Unicode Scalar Values (~4.4 MB) - UTF-8 to UTF-16 (Well-Formed, Assumed Valid)". Description: "A conversion from UTF-8 data to UTF-16 data that contains no ill-formed or incomplete sequences."

There are 11 groups, and 2 data labels (cpu time, real time) per each group with data. Lower is better. 

- ztd_text_view is 11th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.text library conversion routine using the ztd::text::transcode_view range abstraction.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.7719821411133228" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- ztd_text_single_unbounded is 10th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.text library conversion routine using the ztd::text::transcode_one function in a loop, with output bounds checking turned off.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.49859510499751203" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- ztd_text_single is 9th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.text library conversion routine using the ztd::text::transcode_one function.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.48950564100290656" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- utf8cpp is 8th. Described as: "Measures the utf8cpp library and its conversion routines.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.23741122000246834" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- ztd_text is 7th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.text library conversion routine using the ztd::text::transcode function.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.1870624914196702" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry is 6th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with all defaults left alone.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.18002001103714582" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- ztd_text_unbounded is 5th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.text library conversion routine using the ztd::text::transcode function, with output bounds checking turned off.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.17406321715859413" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- simdutf is 4th. Described as: "Measures the performance of Daniel Lemire's simdutf library, which is meant to be highly optimized and performant under all unicode workloads.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.17186524275248682" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_unbounded is 3rd. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with specific conversion pathways overridden (without providing an output size).".
  Measures to a mean of "0.16734371361625172" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- memcpy is 2nd. It has no description.
  Measures to a mean of "0.017102030419921532" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- noop is 1st. Described as: "Measures doing literally nothing (no written expressions/statements in the benchmarking loop). Can be useful for determining potential environment noise.".
  Measures to a mean of "2.2099819034337998e-14" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
