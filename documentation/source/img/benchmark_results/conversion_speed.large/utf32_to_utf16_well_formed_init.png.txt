Title: "All Unicode Scalar Values - UTF-32 to UTF-16 (Well-Formed, with Init)". Description: "A conversion from UTF-32 data to UTF-16 data that contains no ill-formed or incomplete sequences."

There are 9 groups, and 2 data labels (cpu time, real time) per each group with data. Lower is better. 

- icu_ucnv_convertEx is 9th. Described as: "Measures the ICU library and its conversion routines when routed through 2 generic "UConverter" converter objects.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.8146423622280257" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- iconv is 8th. Described as: "Measures the libiconv (GNU version) encoding library, using its POSIX-compliant function call "iconv".".
  Measures to a mean of "0.6577625089287592" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- standard_cpp is 7th. Described as: "Measures the deprecated std::codecvt_* functionality present in the C++ standard library.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.4828420165484643" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_unbounded is 6th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with specific conversion pathways overridden (without providing an output size).".
  Measures to a mean of "0.15337160223212518" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry is 5th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with all defaults left alone.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.13889183614512413" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_unchecked is 4th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with all defaults left alone (without checking for the validity of the input).".
  Measures to a mean of "0.1318941349385729" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_unchecked_unbounded is 3rd. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with specific conversion pathways overridden (without providing an output size, and without checking input validity).".
  Measures to a mean of "0.11897430535713545" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- memcpy is 2nd. It has no description.
  Measures to a mean of "0.017110862298925764" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- noop is 1st. Described as: "Measures doing literally nothing (no written expressions/statements in the benchmarking loop). Can be useful for determining potential environment noise.".
  Measures to a mean of "1.6999780200421812e-14" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
