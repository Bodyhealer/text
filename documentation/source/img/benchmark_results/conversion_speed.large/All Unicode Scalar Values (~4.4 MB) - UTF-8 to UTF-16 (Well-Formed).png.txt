Title: "All Unicode Scalar Values (~4.4 MB) - UTF-8 to UTF-16 (Well-Formed)". Description: "A conversion from UTF-8 data to UTF-16 data that contains no ill-formed or incomplete sequences."

There are 21 groups, and 2 data labels (cpu time, real time) per each group with data. Lower is better.

  This group had an error: "conversion succeeded but produced illegitimate data".
- encoding_c is 20th. Described as: "Measures the performance of the Rust encoding_rs library, called through its C bindings encoding_c (typically statically linked in to achieve the same optimization potential). Used in the Gecko web engine.".
  This group had an error: "unsupported".
