Title: "All Unicode Scalar Values (~4.4 MB) - UTF-16 to UTF-8 (Well-Formed, with Init)". Description: "A conversion from UTF-16 data to UTF-8 data that contains no ill-formed or incomplete sequences."

There are 10 groups, and 2 data labels (cpu time, real time) per each group with data. Lower is better. 

- iconv is 10th. Described as: "Measures the libiconv (GNU version) encoding library, using its POSIX-compliant function call "iconv".".
  Measures to a mean of "0.8813340144400071" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- standard_cpp is 9th. It has no description.
  Measures to a mean of "0.823082423335614" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- icu_ucnv_convertEx is 8th. Described as: "Measures the ICU library and its conversion routines when routed through 2 generic "UConverter" converter objects.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.5100780220015441" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- encoding_c is 7th. Described as: "Measures the performance of the Rust encoding_rs library, called through its C bindings encoding_c (typically statically linked in to achieve the same optimization potential). Used in the Gecko web engine.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.33691539014350763" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry is 6th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with all defaults left alone.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.32348965258040235" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_unchecked is 5th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with all defaults left alone (without checking for the validity of the input).".
  Measures to a mean of "0.3148607629477088" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_unbounded is 4th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with specific conversion pathways overridden (without providing an output size).".
  Measures to a mean of "0.2948554343251922" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_unbounded_unchecked is 3rd. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with specific conversion pathways overridden (without providing an output size, and without checking input validity).".
  Measures to a mean of "0.29241571991735976" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- memcpy is 2nd. It has no description.
  Measures to a mean of "0.01741150540131422" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- noop is 1st. Described as: "Measures doing literally nothing (no written expressions/statements in the benchmarking loop). Can be useful for determining potential environment noise.".
  Measures to a mean of "2.2099819034337998e-14" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
