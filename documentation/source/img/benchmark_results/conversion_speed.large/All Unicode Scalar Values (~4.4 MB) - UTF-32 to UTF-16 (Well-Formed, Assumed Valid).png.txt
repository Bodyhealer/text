Title: "All Unicode Scalar Values (~4.4 MB) - UTF-32 to UTF-16 (Well-Formed, Assumed Valid)". Description: "A conversion from UTF-32 data to UTF-16 data that contains no ill-formed or incomplete sequences."

There are 10 groups, and 2 data labels (cpu time, real time) per each group with data. Lower is better. 

- ztd_text_view is 10th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.text library conversion routine using the ztd::text::transcode_view range abstraction.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.22075117312379006" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry is 9th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with all defaults left alone.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.1325210022090665" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- ztd_text is 8th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.text library conversion routine using the ztd::text::transcode function.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.13012726892900123" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- simdutf is 7th. Described as: "Measures the performance of Daniel Lemire's simdutf library, which is meant to be highly optimized and performant under all unicode workloads.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.12209351808087378" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- ztd_text_unbounded is 6th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.text library conversion routine using the ztd::text::transcode function, with output bounds checking turned off.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.12184233892912745" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_unbounded is 5th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with specific conversion pathways overridden (without providing an output size).".
  Measures to a mean of "0.1178522964075455" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- ztd_text_single_unbounded is 4th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.text library conversion routine using the ztd::text::transcode_one function in a loop, with output bounds checking turned off.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.10290479544912362" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- ztd_text_single is 3rd. Described as: "Measures the ztd.text library conversion routine using the ztd::text::transcode_one function.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.10223030415036338" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- memcpy is 2nd. It has no description.
  Measures to a mean of "0.017105772526360356" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- noop is 1st. Described as: "Measures doing literally nothing (no written expressions/statements in the benchmarking loop). Can be useful for determining potential environment noise.".
  Measures to a mean of "2.2099819034337998e-14" milliseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
