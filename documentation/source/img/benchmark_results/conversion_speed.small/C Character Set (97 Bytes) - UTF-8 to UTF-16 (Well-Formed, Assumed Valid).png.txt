Title: "C Character Set (97 Bytes) - UTF-8 to UTF-16 (Well-Formed, Assumed Valid)". Description: "A conversion from UTF-8 data to UTF-16 data that contains no ill-formed or incomplete sequences."

There are 11 groups, and 2 data labels (cpu time, real time) per each group with data. Lower is better. 

- ztd_text is 11th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.text library conversion routine using the ztd::text::transcode function.".
  Measures to a mean of "589.4245276784724" nanoseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- ztd_text_view is 10th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.text library conversion routine using the ztd::text::transcode_view range abstraction.".
  Measures to a mean of "298.2357479864268" nanoseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- ztd_text_single is 9th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.text library conversion routine using the ztd::text::transcode_one function.".
  Measures to a mean of "109.50194171909972" nanoseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- ztd_text_single_unbounded is 8th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.text library conversion routine using the ztd::text::transcode_one function in a loop, with output bounds checking turned off.".
  Measures to a mean of "108.33009078123725" nanoseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- utf8cpp is 7th. Described as: "Measures the utf8cpp library and its conversion routines.".
  Measures to a mean of "46.5764220919962" nanoseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry is 6th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with all defaults left alone.".
  Measures to a mean of "33.64848896333264" nanoseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_unbounded is 5th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with specific conversion pathways overridden (without providing an output size).".
  Measures to a mean of "19.980914113532364" nanoseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- ztd_text_unbounded is 4th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.text library conversion routine using the ztd::text::transcode function, with output bounds checking turned off.".
  Measures to a mean of "15.64669071420732" nanoseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- simdutf is 3rd. Described as: "Measures the performance of Daniel Lemire's simdutf library, which is meant to be highly optimized and performant under all unicode workloads.".
  Measures to a mean of "15.41961122763626" nanoseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- memcpy is 2nd. It has no description.
  Measures to a mean of "4.360165669651386" nanoseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- noop is 1st. Described as: "Measures doing literally nothing (no written expressions/statements in the benchmarking loop). Can be useful for determining potential environment noise.".
  Measures to a mean of "1.9299797713756563e-07" nanoseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
