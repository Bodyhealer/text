Title: "C Character Set (97 Bytes) - UTF-16 to UTF-32 (Well-Formed, with Init)". Description: "A conversion from UTF-16 data to UTF-32 data that contains no ill-formed or incomplete sequences."

There are 9 groups, and 2 data labels (cpu time, real time) per each group with data. Lower is better. 

- cuneicode_registry_unbounded_unchecked is 9th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with specific conversion pathways overridden (without providing an output size, and without checking input validity).".
  Measures to a mean of "34.22130521611397" microseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_unbounded is 8th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with specific conversion pathways overridden (without providing an output size).".
  Measures to a mean of "33.93285719867738" microseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_unchecked is 7th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with all defaults left alone (without checking for the validity of the input).".
  Measures to a mean of "31.564705105124208" microseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry is 6th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with all defaults left alone.".
  Measures to a mean of "31.25676642879886" microseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- standard_cpp is 5th. It has no description.
  Measures to a mean of "23.81684510698376" microseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- icu_ucnv_convertEx is 4th. Described as: "Measures the ICU library and its conversion routines when routed through 2 generic "UConverter" converter objects.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.7516235022324379" microseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- iconv is 3rd. Described as: "Measures the libiconv (GNU version) encoding library, using its POSIX-compliant function call "iconv".".
  Measures to a mean of "0.6244638232165017" microseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- memcpy is 2nd. It has no description.
  Measures to a mean of "0.005047054260014557" microseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- noop is 1st. Described as: "Measures doing literally nothing (no written expressions/statements in the benchmarking loop). Can be useful for determining potential environment noise.".
  Measures to a mean of "1.929979771375656e-10" microseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
